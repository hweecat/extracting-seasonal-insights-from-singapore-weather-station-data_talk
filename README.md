# Talk: Extracting Seasonal Insights from Singapore Weather Station Data
Making Open Weather Data More Accessible: Extracting Seasonal Insights from Singapore Weather Station Data

Talk (+ short demo) first given at Open UP Global Summit 2019 on 1 December 2019.

Codes adapted from my personal open data API scraping project [Scraping Meteorological Data from Data.gov.sg APIs](https://github.com/hweecat/api_scraping_nea_datasets).

Feel free to file a GitHub issue on this repo if you would like to discuss further on scraping meteorological data from Open Government Data APIs - I'd love to hear your perspectives (and dig your brains)!
